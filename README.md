# ruby-calc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timpeters/ruby-calc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timpeters/ruby-calc)

ruby-calc provides ruby bindings for calc, a c-style arbitrary precision calculator.

For information about calc, see: http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/index.html

## Installation

Calc must be installed.

OS  | Instructions
--- | ------------
Fedora | `sudo yum install calc calc-libs calc-devel`
OS X | Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), then `brew install calc`
Debian/Ubuntu | Calc is packaged as "apcalc", but because it doesn't include a shared library it won't work, so see instructions under "Manual"
Manual | Download and install calc yourself by referring to the calc website, or using `bin/install_calc` from this repository

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-calc', git: 'git://github.com/timpeters/ruby-calc.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-calc

## Usage

The library provides 3 classes

Ruby class | Represents
---------- | ----------
Calc::Z    | Integers
Calc::Q    | Rational numbers (fractions)
Calc::C    | Complex numbers

In calc, all 3 types of numbers can be arbitrarily large/precise.  But ruby Bignum/Rational already do this.  Calc is useful for its rich collection of numeric functions, as well as being able to calculate transcendental functions to arbitrary accuracy.

While incomplete, this library intends to implement the ruby Numeric interface on each class, and also provide wrappers for all numerical functions provided by the calc library.

### Integers

```ruby
# creating integers (following are all equivalent)
z1 = Calc::Z(42)            # fixnum or bignum argument
z2 = Calc::Z(z1)            # another Z argument
z3 = Calc::Z("42")          # strings will be converted
z4 = Calc::Z("0b101010")    # string in binary
z5 = Calc::Z("052")         # string in octal
z6 = Calc::Z("0x2a")        # string in hex

# integer arithmetic works like you'd expect:
z1 + z2  # => Calc::Z(84)
z1 * z2  # => Calc::Z(1764)
z1 - z2  # => Calc::Z(0)
z1 ** z2 # => Calc::Z(150130937545296572356771972164254457814047970568738777235893533016064)

# division in the Z class is integer division.
z1 / 4   # => Calc::Z(10)

# if you actually wanted a rational number, say:
Calc::Q(z1, 4) # => Calc::Q(21/2)
```

### Rational Numbers

```ruby
# creating rational numbers - parameter formats are the same as for Z, except
# there are 2 parameters, a numerator and a denominator.  if you omit the
# denominator, it is assumed to be 1.
q1 = Calc::Q(42)  # equivalent to Calc::Q(42, 1)

# you can also pass a single argument of a plain ruby Rational number:
q2 = Calc::Q(Rational(13,4))  # equivalent to Calc::Q(13, 4)

# rational arithmetic.  you can provide ruby numbers or other calc classes as
# arguments to most operators
q1 + q2   # => Calc::Q(181/4)
q1 - q2   # => Calc::Q(155/4)
q1 * q2   # => Calc::Q(273/2)
q1 / q2   # => Calc::Q(168/13)

# raise to integer power (fractional powers are todo)
q2 ** q1  # => Calc::Q(61040881526285814362156628321386486455989674569/19342813113834066795298816)
```

### Trancendental functions

Transcendental functions such as sin, cos and pi, cannot be evaluated exactly as fractions.  Their ruby-calc wrapers take an extra argument which is the accuracy of the result.  The result will be a rational number within that quantity of the correct value (usually an absolute difference).

```ruby
# calculate pi to 10 decimal places:
epsilon = Calc::Q(1) / Calc::Q("1e10")
Calc::Q.pi(epsilon)  # => Calc::Q(3926990817/1250000000)

# calculate pi to 200 decimal places:
epsilon = Calc::Q(1) / Calc::Q("1e200")
Calc::Q.pi(epsilon)  # => 401 character fraction omitted

# the epsilon value can be omitted, in which case a default (1e-20) is used.
# this is a global variable in the Calc::Q module, and can be modified with
# readers/writers Calc::Q.get_default_epsilon and Calc::Q.set_default_epsilon(e)

Calc::Q.get_default_epsilon # => Calc::Q(1/100000000000000000000)
Calc::Q.set_default_epsilon(1, 1000)
Calc::Q.pi   # => Calc::Q(1571/500)
```

## Development

ruby-calc requires ruby 2.0.0 or newer.

Make sure you have calc development headers installed (yum install calc-dev / apt-get install apcalc-devel, or have manually installed calc).

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
